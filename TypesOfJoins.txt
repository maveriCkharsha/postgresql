                        Nested Loop Join	                        Hash Join	                        Merge Join
Algorithm	        For each outer relation row,        Build a hash from the inner relation, 
                    scan the inner relation	            scan the outer relation, probe the hash	    Sort both relations and merge rows

Indexes that help	Index on the join keys of 
                    the inner relation	                            None	                        Indexes on the join keys of both relations

Good strategy if	the outer table is small	            the hash table fits into work_mem	        both tables are large
