max_parallel_workers_per_gather needs to be greater than zero

Limitations:

- Increases memory usage with high WORK_MEM values, as each hash join or sort operation takes a work_mem amount of memory.
- There is no support for cursors or suspended queries.
- No support for CTEs
- No support for FULL JOIN
