Not only PGBENCH, there is one more tool called HammerDB which is used to test the bench marking of the databases

It can be configurable

1. Configured at number of users
2. Configured at number of ware houses 
3. Configured at number of transactions per user
4. Configured at Total Time to run the test 



At the end, the test results are like below

140 Active virtual users are configured 
TEST RESULT : System achieved 1722391 NOPM from 5216847 MySQL TPM 

NOPM : Number of Orders per minute  (Orders is a table in the default schema created by HammerDB)
    This number tells that number of transactions per minute (How fast are you going)

TPM : 
    How hard your engine is working
