TO maintain Database transcations consistent DB needs to follow certain properties. And they are called ACID properties.

Atomicity - Either the transaction is complete or not

Consistency -  DB must be consistent before and after the transaction

Isolation - Transaction should be independent from the other transcations without inteference. 

Durability - Transaction should hold even when the system fails. 

Transaction Isolation Levels 

    Out of 4 ACID properties, Isolation decides the transaction integrity. 

    Transaction Isolation level is decided based on the below phenonemon.

    1. Dirty Read - Its a state where the transaction reads the data which is not yet committed. 

    2. Non Repetable Read - Reads same row twice and gets different results. 

    3. Phantom read - Occurs when two same queries are executed, but the rows retrieved by the two are different. 


Based on these phenomena, The SQL standard defines four isolation levels :

    Read Uncommitted - Transactions may not read the Uncommitted data 

    Read committed - this level guarantees that any data read is committed at the moment it is read 

    Repetable Read - restrictive level - locks whenever there are any DMLs. 

    Serializable - HIghest isolation level -
