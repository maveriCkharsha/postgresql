TO maintain Database transcations consistent DB needs to follow certain properties. And they are called ACID properties.

Atomicity - Either the transaction is complete or not

Consistency -  DB must be consistent before and after the transaction

Isolation - Transaction should be independent from the other transcations without inteference. 

Durability - Transaction should hold even when the system fails.
