Suppose we wanted to write “1234” to the data file. What if we crashed after “12”? The result would be a broken row somewhere in the table. Perhaps index entries would be missing, and so on – we have to prevent that at all costs.


1. PostgreSQL writes new data first to WAL.
2. WAL sends the data to shared buffers.  (If a read request comes in, it will not make it to the data files anyway – because the data is found in the cache.)
3. After a checkpoint, the data is written to data files using BG Writer.
